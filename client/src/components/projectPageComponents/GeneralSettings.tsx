//This component is used in the project member view of the project page
//Contains the layout of the 'General' tab of the project settings menu
//Should contain info regarding details of the project, as well as the ability to change said details
//This includes what picture the project uses as a profile, the name of the project,
//  The theme of its virtual space, and whether or not the project is currently hiring new people
//  More project options may need to be added in the future depending on the overall site design
//Also contains a save button that should write any changes made in this menu to the database
//There is currently an issue where swapping between the tabs of the settings window will reset any inputs
//  made within this tab if they weren't saved. Ideally, this shouldn't happen unless the entire settings
//  window is closed without saving.

// projectId is passed through props, which is used to ensure correct data is pulled
