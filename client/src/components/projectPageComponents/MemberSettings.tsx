//This component is used in the project member view of the Project page
//Contains the layout of the 'Member' tab in the project settings menu
//There is a button that should allow for inviting users to become project members assuming they are an admin or similar
//When rendered, displays a list of project members that are rendered with several 'MemberListing' components
//Uses a 'SearchBar' component to assist with sorting through project members
//Currently, the SearchBar does not function correctly due to how it and the current data is structured
//    It currently searches through the project's member data rather than profile data, and no data on user's names are present there
//    'true' and 'false' also manage to return results despite there being no indicators present within the display due to boolean values used in the data

//A projectId value is passed in to load members of the corresponding project
//tempSettings is also passed in containing the current settings inputed
//A function for updating members is also passed in to be used in individual member listings
